# Student-Hub
This is a practice project to practice my css skills im gonna try to make a student dashboard page. This is gonna be a preview of my fututre project called student hub im gonna give to my universty and this will look like the student or admin dashboard on the real website im gonna make them.

This project is far from perfect of even good its not responsive and has many fixed units but i only did it as a practice for the grid system.
